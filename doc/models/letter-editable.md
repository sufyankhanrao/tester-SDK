## Structure

`LetterEditable`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description | Getter | Setter |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Description` | `String` | Optional | An internal description that identifies this resource. Must be no longer than 255 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `255` | String getDescription() | setDescription(String description) |
| `Metadata` | [`Metadata`](/doc/models/metadata.md) | Optional | Use metadata to store custom information for tagging and labeling back to your internal systems. Must be an object with up to 20 key-value pairs. Keys must be at most 40 characters and values must be at most 500 characters. Neither can contain the characters `"` and `\`. Nested objects are not supported. See [Metadata](#section/Metadata) for more information. | Metadata getMetadata() | setMetadata(Metadata metadata) |
| `MergeVariables` | `Object` | Optional | You can input a merge variable payload object to your template to render dynamic content. For example, if you have a template like: `{{variable_name}}`, pass in `{"variable_name": "Harry"}` to render `Harry`. `merge_variables` must be an object. Any type of value is accepted as long as the object is valid JSON; you can use `strings`, `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`, `objects`, or `null`. The max length of the object is 25,000 characters. If you call `JSON.stringify` on your object, it can be no longer than 25,000 characters. Your variable names cannot contain any whitespace or any of the following special characters: `!`, `"`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `````, `{`, `\|`, `}`, `~`. More instructions can be found in [our guide to using html and merge variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables). Depending on your [Merge Variable strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account) setting, if you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here, you will either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty string. | Object getMergeVariables() | setMergeVariables(Object mergeVariables) |
| `SendDate` | `Object` | Optional | A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed, that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted to UTC. | Object getSendDate() | setSendDate(Object sendDate) |
| `MailType` | [`MailTypeEnum`](/doc/models/mail-type-enum.md) | Optional | A string designating the mail postage type:<br><br>* `usps_first_class` - (default)<br>* `usps_standard` - a [cheaper option](https://lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) which is<br>  less predictable and takes longer to deliver. `usps_standard` cannot be used with `4x6`<br>  postcards or for any postcards sent outside of the United States.<br>**Default**: `MailTypeEnum.USPS_FIRST_CLASS`<br>*Default: `MailTypeEnum.USPS_FIRST_CLASS`* | MailTypeEnum getMailType() | setMailType(MailTypeEnum mailType) |
| `Color` | `boolean` | Required | Set this key to `true` if you would like to print in color. Set to `false` if you would like to print in black and white. | boolean getColor() | setColor(boolean color) |
| `DoubleSided` | `Boolean` | Optional | Set this attribute to `true` for double sided printing, or `false` for for single sided printing. Defaults to `true`.<br>**Default**: `true`<br>*Default: `true`* | Boolean getDoubleSided() | setDoubleSided(Boolean doubleSided) |
| `AddressPlacement` | [`AddressPlacementEnum`](/doc/models/address-placement-enum.md) | Optional | Specifies the location of the address information that will show through the double-window envelope. To see how this will impact your letter design, view our letter template.<br><br>* `top_first_page` - (default) print address information at the top of your provided first page<br>* `insert_blank_page` - insert a blank address page at the beginning of your file (you will be charged for the extra page)<br>* `bottom_first_page_center` - **(deprecation planned within a few months)** print address information at the bottom center of your provided first page<br>* `bottom_first_page` - print address information at the bottom of your provided first page<br>**Default**: `AddressPlacementEnum.TOP_FIRST_PAGE`<br>*Default: `AddressPlacementEnum.TOP_FIRST_PAGE`* | AddressPlacementEnum getAddressPlacement() | setAddressPlacement(AddressPlacementEnum addressPlacement) |

| `PerforatedPage` | `Integer` | Optional | Required if `return_envelope` is `true`. The number of the page that should be perforated for use with the return envelope. Must be greater than or equal to `1`. The blank page added by `address_placement=insert_blank_page` will be ignored when considering the perforated page number. To see how perforation will impact your letter design, view our [perforation guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_perf_template.pdf). | Integer getPerforatedPage() | setPerforatedPage(Integer perforatedPage) |
| `CustomEnvelope` | [`CustomEnvelope`](/doc/models/custom-envelope.md) | Optional | A nested custom envelope object containing more information about the custom envelope used or `null` if a custom envelope was not used.<br><br>Accepts an envelope ID for any customized envelope with available inventory.

Non-US addresses will be standardized into uppercase only. If a US address used does not meet your account’s [US Mail strictness setting](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account), the request will fail. [Lob Guide: Verification of Mailing Addresses](https://www.lob.com/guides#mailing_addresses) | Object getTo() | setTo(Object to) |
| `From` | `Object` | Required | Must either be an address ID or an inline object with correct address parameters. Must be a US address unless using a `custom_envelope`.
